This project uses a Runge-Kutta algorithm of order 4 in order to approximate first order differential equations.

This calculator accepts equations in the form of dy/dx = f(x, y)
In order to use it, simply input a function of x and y into the "func" definiton, and then run the main file with the proper parameters:
- n: number of steps used in approximation
- x0: the initial x value of the differential equation
- y0: the initial y value of the differential equation
- xf: the desired x value
